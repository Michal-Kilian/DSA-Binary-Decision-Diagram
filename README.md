# DSA-Binary-Decision-Diagram

This project represents the 2nd assignment for the course Data Structures & Algorithm. It contains the Binary Decision Diagram (BDD). BDD is a rooted, directed, acyclic graph. Nonterminal nodes in such graph are called decision nodes. Each decision node is labeled by a Boolean variable and has two child nodes, referred to as low child and high child. This project is written entirely in the Java programming language.
